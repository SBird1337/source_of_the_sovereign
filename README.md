## General
This repository provides insight into the Fangame `Pokémon Sovereign of the Skies` which is maintained since 2010. The project is lead by a 
german team, which is why most of the community around it is as well german. You can find our main project thread on `RomhackersWorld`: [Pokémon Sovereign of the Skies](https://board.romhackersworld.eu/board/206-pokemon-sovereign-of-the-skies/)

Since this is a playable game, most of the assets maintained by us would be heavily spoiling the experience. On the other hand, we want to have our source code publicly available, which is why we have only part of the repository publicly available for you, sorry!

## Building
Building the repository without access to all the assets is not possible. Though we are using a collection of tools, which is also publicly available for you: [sots-tools](https://github.com/ipatix/sots-tools)
